In previous versions of `jbang`, Java 10+ direct launch of `.java` was used, but since v0.6 `jbang` works with Java 8 and thus it needs to do a separate compile step. Besides now working with Java 8 this also allows to cache the compiled script and thus launch faster on consecutive runs.

The caching goes to `~/.jbang/cache` by default, you can run `jbang cache clear` to remove all cache data from this folder.

The default cache location can be overwritten by the environment variable `JBANG_CACHE_DIR`. If `JBANG_DIR` environment variable is set, the `cache` folder will be placed there.
